Known Issue:
Better multi-lingual support is coming with an update for the GUI API. For now, if a certain language is needed, download a TTF of that language and place it in the same directory as `FFVIPR Save Editor.exe` and then start the application.
Google search with `"free [language] fonts"` for TTF downloads. Replace `[lanugage]` with what you need, ie: `"free japanese fonts"`
